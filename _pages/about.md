I am a Graduate Research Assistant pursuing my PhD under Prof. [Arijit Raychowdhury](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/arijit-raychowdhury) at the [ICSRL](https://icsrl.ece.gatech.edu) at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu). My current research focus is on Cryogenic VLSI Circuits where I build and test circuits operating at ultra low temperatures \(-270 Celsius\!\!\). I also work on building models and creating TCAD structures to predict the circuit behavior at these temperatures. Most of my work is aimed to achieve better performance, but these circuits are necessary for building Quantum Computers in the future. 

I am an Electronics Engineer with Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [B.M.S College of Engineering](https://bmsce.ac.in) and worked as a faculty for 1 year. I then graduated with MS Honors in [Electrical Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu) from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu) Los Angeles and worked as Graphics Hardware Engineer at [Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) in Folsom California for more than 2 years. 

I am a fan of Carnatic Classical Music in both vocal and instrumental form and listen to them in my free time. I also enjoy cooking and baking. 

I am looking for Academic/Faculty Positions. Please feel free to browse through my website to know more about my work and reach out for a copy of my Research Statement.
