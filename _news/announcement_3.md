#### Abstract 
The quest for high yield has motivated significant advancement in 2.5D integrated circuits, where chiplets are integrated on a silicon interposer or a package substrate with high-speed parallel communication among them. These channels for 2.5D integrated systems need to have high data bandwidth per unit length (also called shoreline-BW-density and measured in Gb/s/mm) and lower energy per bit area (measured in pJ/b). Typically, NRZ signalling is used but achieving higher data rates continues to be a major challenge. In this paper we explore PAM4 as an alternative to NRZ for signalling the channels. Simulations show that we can achieve up to 63% more energy-efficiency and 27% higher BW density for 2.5D integrated systems.
