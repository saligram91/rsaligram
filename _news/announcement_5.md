The benchmarking of Arm Cores at Cryogenic Temperatures has been accepted for the CICC-2021 under the Modelling and Design Automation for Emerging Applications track.

#### Abstract 
In this paper, we present the first microprocessor-level simulation studies at super-cooled\(150K– 230K\) and cryo-cooled \(\<150K\) temperatures. We calibrate transistor and wire models to existing first-generation FinFET models and modify them to include low-temperature sensitivities. We then re-characterize FinFET standard cells over a sweep of temperatures \(100K–300K\), and use the cells to implement an Arm® Cortex®-A53 CPU.
