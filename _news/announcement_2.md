Rakshith Saligram received the ORNL Seed Research Award for his proposed research on “Cryogenic CMOS interface circuits for superconducting quantum circuits.”

With recent advances in quantum computing and the development of quantum computing hardware, there is a need to enable cryogenic CMOS circuits that can act as drivers, read-out circuits, digital interfaces, and storage to augment quantum machines. Rakshith’s proposed work addresses the design and characterization of CMOS peripheral circuits all the way down to 4K. This is based on initial work by Rakshith where he has demonstrated successful operation of 28nm foundry transistors with superior electrical characteristics scaled down to 4K. This work is well aligned with Georgia Tech’s newly founded Georgia Tech Quantum Alliance (GTQA).
