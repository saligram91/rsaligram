#### Abstract 
Cryogenic CMOS processors need low latency, high  bandwidth access  to  high-density on-die cache memory to  maximize  performance. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate,for the first time, pseudo-static random access memory operation of a 1T Capacitorless Floating Body DRAM using 22nm FDSOI transistor, down to 4.8K, suitable for cryogenic cache  memory.  We demonstrate  a 1T Cryo-DRAM (W/L=120nm/20nm) that  exhibit: (a) record  high sensing  current and sense margin  (Î”IRead=IRead1-IRead0), (b) pseudo-static retention  characteristics(>10^5sec);  (c)  high write endurance >10^10cycles,  and  (d) non-destructive  read cycles  >10^16, suitable for  cache  application. Benchmarking reveals that 1T  Cryo-DRAM  outperforms Cryo-SRAM and Cryo-STT-MRAM in memory density by 10x and 50x; in read/write  energy by 2.7x/2.4x and 1.3x/1.5x and in  read latency by  1.46x and  1.80x respectively for a cache  size of 2MB. Hence, 1T  Cryo-DRAM is a viable option for L2/L3 cache in high-performance cryogenic computing.
